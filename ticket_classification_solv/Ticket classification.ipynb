After signing up with the intent to complete these requirements a Citibank representative confirmed that the offer applied to my new account and that I should complete the offer requirements. This confirmation was communicated via their online secure message feature, and I have attached a copy for reference. Once I completed the requirements as directed I inquired about the expected delivery date of the earned bonus via secure message and I was told that my account was not targeted and that I would not receive the bonus as promised. This conflicts with what I was previously told and I have already spent a considerable amount of time to meet the requirements as directed. \",\n",

I called the company ( Chase ) and was told I 'm being charged 5 % of the balance for my minimum. They said it was in my terms but I have never seen that and have n't had any other credit card ask for that high of a minimum payment.

For the past 16 months, I have been responsibly making {$450.00} in payments every month for my private student loans for a total of {$7200.00} in the aforementioned months. Because of high interest rates ranging from 8.25 % to 12.5 %, only {$2200.00} of my paid {$7200.00} have made a dent on my grand total which is nearly {$50000.00}. I completely understand that I have signed contracts which stated that my interest rates would be within these high margins and variable and therefore, I have really done my best to take responsibility for my student loan repayment. However, I took out these loans when I was   years old because my parents were experiencing economic hardships and their credit scores at that time did not qualify them to take out parent plus loans to help supplement my tuition. \",\n",

However, I was told that since the payment would n't post until the next business day I was in fact 30 days late. I explained to the rep, I even spoke to two supervisors who advised me that there was nothing that I can do. I explained that I was a   Vet and that I was juggling two households because I take care of my father under  . I even wrote them a letter pleading my case. That I did n't intend to fall behind, I just let the date get beyond me. This is affecting my credit and my employment because I need a security clearance to perform my job.
