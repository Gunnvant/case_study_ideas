## Case Study Ideas and DataSets

This repo contains case study ideas and datasets. The directory structure is self explanatory:
- data: This contains the raw and final datasets. The general structure is `/data/case_study/*.json,*.txt,*.csv`
- notebooks: These contain the data splitting and exploration code. The general structure is `/notebooks/case_study/*.ipynb`
- write_ups:These contain either WIP ideas or final writeup to be shared with students. The general structure is `/write_ups/case_study/*.md`
