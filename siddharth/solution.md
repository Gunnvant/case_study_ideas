## Solution Airbnb Case Study

This is the official solution to Airbnb case study. The structure of the solution is as follows:
1. [File 1](Airbnb%20Data%20Understanding%20and%20feature%20creation.ipynb): This contains the logic and the code for one of the approaches to aggregate the data. This file is the starting point.
2. [File 2](./Data%20Quality%20and%20checks.ipynb): This contains the logic and yhe code for the approach that we have followed in doing Data Quality checks on the aggregated data produced in step 1
3. [File 3](./Variable%20profiling%20and%20checking%20relationships%20between%20variables.ipynb): This contains the logic for doing check of relationships between different variables and the target variable to be modelled
4. [File 4](./Modelling%20and%20insights.ipynb): This contains the logic and code for building different models and their comparison.

Keep in mind, this work is more of a guidance as to how to approach such problems. There are some subjective choices we have made and that would be true for any analysis task you would undertake.
